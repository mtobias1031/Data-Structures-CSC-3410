Man, I came in just to get my partnas poppin'
Got my diamonds jumpin' like they hoppin' scotchin'
I mean strip I'm tipping for a lotta lobster
I been doing this shit for a lot of drummas
And my whole crew is worth like a lot of commas
Keep the peace just like Dali Llama
And I'm probably fuckin' on your daughter's mama
Blunt is louder than a fuckin' concert
I mean, ye your honor, ye your honor
I will never ever tell nobody
Beverly Willsha I run round the lobby
Stack a ferrari mike told me he got me
Excuse if I'm cocky, I prove it like ya know
Get money Nike, just do it like Ye' now
Zone 6, bricks, free Gucci in this bitch
Know I'm always with the shits
Said its eastside, A-town
I don't gotta tell 'em cause they know nigga (know nigga)
Did it for the set so I don't owe niggas (owe niggas)
Ya'll still nickel and dimin' that dope nigga
I just made a couple thou' off a show nigga
Probably somewhere out witcho' ho, nigga (ho nigga)
I will never go out as a broke nigga (broke nigga)
Fuck a TV, I show, nigga (show nigga)
